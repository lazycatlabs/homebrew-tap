  caveats <<~EOS
    Copaste is not notarized yet, so macOS blocks the first launch.
    Open it once, then go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and click
    "Open Anyway".

    To paste straight into other apps it needs Accessibility permission,
    which it asks for the first time you paste.
